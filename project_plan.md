Software Quality Assurance Project Plan : 

Each person must research and find 5 good quality resources related to each of the three topics:
Task estimation in Scrum (Kavon, Niall)
Code reviews (Brian, Kavon)
Extra topic (Niall, Brian)

Write introductions and summarise guidelines for each topic :
- Identify common themes amongst the different resources.
- Write a brief introduction to each of the topics.
- Summarise the most important guidelines using bullet points and include where necessary diagrams.
- Highlight bad practices to avoid and good practices to follow.
- Add links to the reference articles for further reading.
- Create diagrams and visuals for each topic.

Create github repo(Kavon)

Each group member will then clone the repo, create a branch and finally push their work to github. We will then review the changes made and decide to merge to the master branch or not. 

Each member will then review and edit the handbook.

Finalise and submit the handbook


Changes we would make as a team :

1. Improve communication: Although we worked very well as a team, we could have established more effective channels of communication, such as more regular team meetings or using collaboration tools to keep everyone even more informed and engaged.

2. Set clearer expectations: We could have defined our roles and responsibilities better for each team member even earlier to avoid confusion and ensure everyone knows what is expected of them. 

3. Better time management: We could have developed a more realistic project timeline and milestones, taking into account potential setbacks, and review progress regularly to ensure the team stays on track. We managed to finish the project early as planned to review our work, but even earlier would have been beneficial.

4. Enhance resource allocation: We could have evaluated and optimised the distribution of resources better to ensure that we understoofd the topic more clearly.
