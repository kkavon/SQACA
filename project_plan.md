Software Quality Assurance Project Plan : 

Each person must research and find 5 good quality resources related to each of the three topics:
Task estimation in Scrum (Kavon, Niall)
Code reviews (Brian, Kavon)
Extra topic (Niall, Brian)

Write introductions and summarise guidelines for each topic :
- Identify common themes amongst the different resources.
- Write a brief introduction to each of the topics.
- Summarise the most important guidelines using bullet points and include where necessary diagrams.
- Highlight bad practices to avoid and good practices to follow.
- Add links to the reference articles for further reading.
- Create diagrams and visuals for each topic.

Create github repo(Kavon)

Each group member will then clone the repo, create a branch and finally push their work to github. We will then review the changes made and decide to merge to the master branch or not. 

Each member will then review and edit the handbook.

Finalise and submit the handbook
